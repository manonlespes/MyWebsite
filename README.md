My website introducing my experiences and backgrounds - check this out !

I had such fun when coding it. The most challenging part was the use of loops and callbacks in JS. 

I must recognise that I am quite proud of what I have done so far. For sure, it could be optimised, and this is one of the reasons I am seeking for an internship, in order to write a clearer code.

Let's discuss about it, I'd be delighted to hear from you :)
